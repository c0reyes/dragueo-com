On this page you can find the times that the racers perform with their cars in track of the Autodromo Las Americas. All races was sent by [Dragueo software](https://github.com/c0reyes/Dragueo) are save in database and display in a dynamic dragtree drawing with javascript. The pilots can check their stats in the history and view the more faster racers.
